### **Accessing a File in the Project Folder**
Assume your project structure looks like this:

```
MyProject
│
├── example.txt       <- File you want to read
├── Program.cs        <- Your C# code
├── bin
│   └── Debug
│       └── netX.X    <- Where the compiled application runs
```

To read `example.txt` from the project folder, you can construct the path dynamically:
```csharp
string fileName = "../../../example.txt";
